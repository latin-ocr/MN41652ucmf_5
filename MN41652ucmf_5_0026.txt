King hae heard onr Freshman class read the intro-1

duotory treatiseS, and has prepared elementary expo-i
sitien and grammatica} references to smooth the path ³*
of beginners3 and Prot. Bloombergh has read the
Apology‚ andmade notes on the peculiarities of Ter-
tullian‚ esperially of his syntax, in which studento witi
recognize the nioety and aeonraoy of the best German
. scholarship. Two treatises of the highest interest have
been left without notes for teaohers who prefer to
have their studente read without suoh aide. Gram-
matieal remarks and a eopions index have been added.
On the whole, it is hoped the book may answer pretty

. well the modest purpose for which it is pubiished.
