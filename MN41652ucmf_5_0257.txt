Anaron had been long famous for herschools of rhet-
oric, and the promising field she afforded skilll'ul lawyers
(Juvenal, vil, 147). Alter Tacitus, she was for three
centuries the prinoipal mother and nurse of eminent Latin
authors. The heathen writers Apuleius and Macrobius, ,
and the Christian, Minucius Felix, Tertullian, Cyprian,

known names of the period, aad are all Africans, and
they were followed by Angustiae. The Latin langue-ge

was studied with care. Apuleius suggests that his hear-
ers toler·ated no bad grammar or pronunciation, or slor-

laccismum ignoverit? quis vel unam syllabam barbare ,
pronunciatan'r donaverit? quis incondita et vitiosa rerba
temere, 'quasi delirantibus oborientia, permiserit blatte-
rare?” (Florid, i., 9). There is a certain resemblance
among these writers in their style and diction:

1. There is more or less infiation and verbosity, the so-
ealled tricator A fidenates. Ι

2. There are peculiarities of collocation, suoh as might
arise, perhaps, from thinking iu some language uulike the
Latin. Α f„

3. There are many infr ⁴guent wordS, or senses of words,
almost all of which, however, are found in older Latin
writers (often in Plautus or Lucretius), or arc obvious
Graecisms

The style of Tertullian has tlte following traits:
