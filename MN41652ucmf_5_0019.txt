Ir is remarkable that no place hasbeen given iu the
schools and collegas of England and America to the writ-
ings of the early Christiana For many centurias, and
down to what is called the Pagan Renaissanca they were
the common linguistio study ofeducated Christiaus. The
stern piety of those times thought it wrong to* dally with
the sensual frivolities ‘of heathen poeta, and never imag-
ined it possible that the best years of ; youth should be
spontin mastering the rcfinenrcnts of a mythology an'd
life which at first they feared and loathed, aud which at
last became as remote and unrcal to them as the Veda is
to us. i

Classical Philology‚ however, took its ideal of heauty
from Pagan G1·eecc‚and it has fillcd our sohools with
those books which are its best representatives.

The modern Scienoe of Language has again changed
the point ofnview. It gives the first place to truth3 it
sccks to know man, his thoughts, his growth3 it looks on
the literature of an age as a dagucrreotypc of the agc3
it valucs books according to their historical significanoe.
The writings of the early Christians embody‘the history
of the most important events known tc man, in language '
not unworthy of thc events, and the study of Latin and
Greek as ssvehiol'es of Christian thought should be'thc
most fruitful study known to Philology‚ and haro its
‚ lace of honor in the University Oourse
